## 🔐 Security & Data Persistence

This project currently does **not** implement:

* Authentication or authorization
* Persistent chat storage (e.g., databases)
* End-to-end encryption

These features can be added in future versions for production readiness.

## 🧩 Potential Enhancements

Here are some suggestions for extending the project:

* [ ] Add user login/registration
* [ ] Store chat history using MongoDB or PostgreSQL
* [ ] Display connected users in the room
* [ ] Add typing indicators and read receipts
* [ ] Enable chat rooms with unique URLs
* [ ] Improve UI using a framework like Tailwind CSS or Material UI
